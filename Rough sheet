Dear Dusty,

I hope you're doing well.
I’m writing to formally resign from my position at Total Apex Media, effective immediately. Due to my current schedule, I no longer have the time to continue with the job.

Thank you for the opportunity to work with the team. I’ve learned a lot during my time here, and I truly appreciate the experience.

Wishing you and Total Apex Media continued success.

Best regards,

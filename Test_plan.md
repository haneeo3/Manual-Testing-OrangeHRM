## 🎯 Objective
To verify the functional behavior and UI of OrangeHRM's core features — including login, leave management, recruitment, and the admin panel — ensuring that the application meets its requirements and provides a smooth, bug-free experience for its users.

---

## 🎯 Scope

## 🧪 Test Approach

- **Test Execution**: Perform tests in Chrome browser
- **Test Reporting**: Log bugs in `Bug_Reports.md` and results in `Test_Cases.xlsx`
